"description": "This cluster of papers explores the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, focusing on neurotransmission, GABAergic and glutamatergic systems, neuronal circuits, astrocyte function, NMDA receptors, dendritic spines, and long-term potentiation. The research also investigates the relevance of these mechanisms to neurological disorders.",
